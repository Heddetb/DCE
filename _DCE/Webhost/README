For setting up the webhost you can copy and paste these files into your FTP server as a demo. The team-11 folder is a folder with demo pictures for tags 1-4. This folder only gets used as picture source when team-11 is selected. If you decide to use annother team you will need to make a folder of that team and fill it with pictures you like to use for each tag.
